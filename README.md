# Toggle PoE Power via Script on a Cisco SG 200-08P Switch
The Cisco SG200 series switches do not have the remote SSH feature, so the only
way interface with it via HTTP.
This script allows you to login to your Cisco switch to toggle PoE power on
individual ports so you don't have to use the HTTP interface.
So far this has only been tested on a SG 200-08P.
